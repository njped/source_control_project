        <p>There are many things I like to do with my family. A lot of the times I will play boardgames with my family. It is really fun. It feels like we try a new game every single week. It's funny just thinking about it. Our game closet downstairs in our basement has a lot of games there. I wonder if I've played all the games we have in there. Like other families, we go to the theatres to watch movies or go to little sports area like Top Golf to play sports casually. I really doing things with my family.</p>

        <p>I love playing video games it one of my favorite things that I like to do in my spare time. Right now I'm replaying Spider Man Miles Morales. I enjoy the game it's short and has a few different mechanics then the other Spider Man game.</p>

        <p>I love reading books expecially manga and light novels which are japenese book and comic books. There are fun to read and I really like watching the anime or the TV adaptation of the manga/light novel. My favorite anime/light novel is Reincarnated as a Slime. It is very interesting series idea of a person dying and then being reincarnted as a slime in magical fantasy world. He meets different types of monsters and he establishes a monster country.</p>
